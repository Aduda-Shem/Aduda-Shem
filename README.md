## WHOAMI 
<p>  
I am a computer programmer at heart with a cybersecurity background and I enjoy using my skills to craft functional code that solves problems and make work easier.
  
When I'm not coding, you can find me tinkering with new technologies or staying up late to play with my latest projects. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn
